    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      At Heritage Horizons Museum, our mission to illuminate the past continues to shape the future. In 2024, we welcomed over 220,000 visitors through our doors, with nearly half participating in interactive exhibits that brought ancient civilizations, forgotten revolutions, and everyday lives of the past to vibrant life. Through partnerships with local schools and cultural institutions, we provided free educational programs to more than 35,000 students, cultivating historical curiosity in the next generation of thinkers and leaders.
