        <h2>Dr. Sara Omari Reyes</h2>
        <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr. Sara Omari Reyes is a museum interpretation specialist whose work centers on revealing suppressed or obscured histories embedded within ancient material cultures. Trained in both archaeology and cultural studies, she brings a diasporic Afro-Caribbean and Indigenous Taíno perspective to her interpretive practice. Reyes specializes in recontextualizing artifacts through community collaboration, foregrounding ritual, cosmology, and resistance rather than empire, conquest, or linear progress. She has served as a cultural consultant for international repatriation cases and lectures widely on decolonizing museum spaces. Her interpretive installations often incorporate multi-sensory storytelling, challenging visitors to feel history rather than merely view it.</p>
