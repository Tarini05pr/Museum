      <h2>Limestone Carving</h2>
      <p class="description">Carved limestone (fine-grained, pale beige, common in Levantine quarries); Location Found: Excavated near the ruins of Tell Asmar, Iraq (33.098° N, 44.584° E) — a site associated with early Mesopotamian temples. The carving was discovered in a collapsed wall section of a small shrine structure, about 1.2 meters below the surface, alongside fragments of ceramic bowls and burnt reed matting; Purpose: The stone carving appears to depict a stylized human figure with large almond-shaped eyes and clasped hands, consistent with votive figures dedicated to temple deities. Its purpose was likely ritual or devotional, functioning as an offering placed inside a sacred space to represent the perpetual prayer of its donor.</p>
      <p class="price">$25.00</p>
