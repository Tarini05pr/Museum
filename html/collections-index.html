        <h3>Artifact 1</h3>
        <img src="../images/collections/arch-artifact1.png" alt="Artifact 1" class="artifact-img">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> The Viracocha Sun Tablet</li>
          <li><strong>Material:</strong> Andesite stone (fine-grained volcanic rock)</li>
          <li><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Rectangular slab, 32 cm × 20 cm × 5 cm; weighs approximately 6.8 kg</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> ~1,200 years old; inferred from stratigraphic layer context and ceramic typology at the site</li>
          <li><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Excellent; minor edge weathering but carvings remain sharp and fully legible</li>
          <li><strong>Location Found:</strong> Excavated at Cerro Qhapaq, near Lake Titicaca, Bolivia (16.167° S, 69.000° W), from a sealed offering pit 1.8 meters below surface</li>
          <li><strong>Use and Function</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Ceremonial tablet, possibly used as an altar piece or dedicatory offering to the sun deity Viracocha</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Slight polishing around the central deity figure suggests repeated handling; traces of red ochre pigment remain in recessed carvings, indicating it may have been painted for rituals</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Tool marks from a fine bronze chisel are visible under magnification; geometric border motifs are consistent with Tiwanaku-style iconography from the Late Horizon period</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Found With:</strong> Three miniature ceramic vessels, charred llama bone fragments, and a small bundle of woven reed cords</li>
          <li><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Found in a ritual offering pit, not associated with human remains, suggesting a votive rather than funerary purpose</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The central figure, wearing a radiating headdress and holding twin staffs, resembles the “Staff God” motif, a key symbol in Andean cosmology representing order, fertility, and divine authority. Spiral flanking patterns may symbolize flowing water or spiritual energy</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Strongly resembles carved stone panels from Tiwanaku’s Kalasasaya Temple, though its smaller portable size suggests it was made for localized ceremonial use rather than monumental architecture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Artifact 2</h3>
        <img src="../images/collections/arch-artifact2.png" alt="Artifact 2" class="artifact-img">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> The Nok Guardian Figurine</li>
          <li><strong>Material:</strong> Terracotta clay, mixed with fine quartz inclusions</li>
          <li><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> 48 cm tall × 15 cm wide at the base; weight ~4.2 kg; elongated human form with stylized head and intricate facial features</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> ~2,300 years old; thermoluminescence dating confirms age within ±150 years</li>
          <li><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Partial but stable; torso, head, and base intact, with missing left arm and erosion to the facial surface from centuries of burial</li>
          <li><strong>Location Found:</strong> Excavated at Taruga site, central Nigeria (9.200° N, 7.000° E), found within a collapsed domestic structure’s wall foundation</li>
          <li><strong>Use and Function</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Ritual figurine placed as a protective guardian for a household or community granary</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Microscopic traces of burnt organic resin at the base suggest it may have been affixed to a platform or altar; surface soot deposits hint at occasional exposure to hearth fires during ceremonies</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Hand-modeled from locally sourced clay, then fired in an open pit; facial detailing carved with bone or wooden tools, while geometric torso patterns were impressed with woven fiber mats before firing</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Found With:</strong> Shards of decorated pottery, iron smelting slag, and small quantities of charred pearl millet grains</li>
          <li><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Situated within the corner of a building’s foundation trench, possibly a symbolic placement to safeguard the inhabitants or stored food</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Enlarged eyes and patterned chest may signify spiritual vigilance and fertility; motifs align with known Nok cultural emphasis on agricultural prosperity and ancestor protection</li>

        <h3>Artifact 3</h3>
        <img src="../images/collections/arch-artifact3.png" alt="Artifact 3" class="artifact-img">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> The Moon Priest’s Bronze Dagger</li>
          <li><strong>Material:</strong> Cast bronze alloy (copper with 12% tin, trace amounts of arsenic)</li>
          <li><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Blade length 27 cm, hilt 10 cm; total weight ~0.9 kg; leaf-shaped double-edged blade with slightly flared guard and flattened pommel</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> ~3,800 years old; metallurgical analysis and contextual dating place it in the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1800 BCE)</li>
          <li><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Excellent for age; blade exhibits moderate patina but remains structurally sound; faint engravings still visible along one side</li>
          <li><strong>Location Found:</strong> Excavated at the ruins of Mari (modern-day Tell Hariri, Syria), in a sealed chamber beneath a temple platform, coordinates approx. 34.555° N, 40.894° E</li>
          <li><strong>Use and Function</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Ceremonial weapon used in lunar temple rites; unlikely to have been employed as a battlefield weapon due to ornate and delicate hilt</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Microscopic polishing along the grip suggests repeated handling; residues of beeswax and cedar oil absorbed into the hilt wrapping indicate ritual anointing; no significant combat wear on blade edge</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Cast in a two-part stone mold, then cold-worked along edges; faint inlay channels along hilt suggest decorative shell or semi-precious stone inlays now lost; moon and star motifs chiseled post-casting</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Found With:</strong> A crescent-shaped silver pectoral ornament, a small alabaster oil jar, and three clay tablets inscribed in Akkadian referencing lunar festivals</li>
          <li><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Placed in a dedicatory cache beneath the floor of the temple’s inner sanctum, alongside other sacred objects</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Engraved crescent and rosette designs are associated with the Mesopotamian moon god Sin (Nanna); weapon form may symbolize divine protection over the temple and its priests</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Similar in size and alloy composition to ceremonial daggers found at Ebla and Ur, though the combination of lunar iconography and temple context makes this example unusually specific to Mari’s religious practices</li>

      <article class="artifact">
        <h3>Artifact 4</h3>
        <img src="../images/collections/anth-artifact1.png" alt="Artifact 4" class="artifact-img">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> Zoomorphic Ceramic Vessel (Bovine Form)</li>
          <li><strong>Material:</strong> Terracotta (fired clay)</li>
          <li><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Approx. 25–30 cm in length, 20 cm in height (visual estimate); Estimated 1.5–2.5 kg (typical for solid terracotta of this size); Hollow-bodied vessel in the shape of a four-legged animal (likely a cow or bull) with a wide circular spout on the back</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> Approx. 1200–800 BCE; Inferred from stylistic parallels with Pre-Columbian or early Mesoamerican zoomorphic pottery; Carbon dating likely applied to associated organic materials if available</li>
          <li><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Complete and well-preserved; no visible cracks or losses; Surface shows even weathering and patina, indicating age but good condition</li>
          <li><strong>Location Found:</strong> Exact site unknown (hypothetical entry), but similar vessels have been found in: Central Mexico, Guerrero region; Often associated with domestic or ceremonial archaeological layers</li>
          <li><strong>Use and Function</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Ceremonial or ritualistic object; The animal shape and decorative elements suggest symbolic or sacred function beyond practical use</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> No visible charring or soot on the spout or interior lip; Minor polishing on the back/spout may suggest repeated handling or pouring; Internal residue analysis (if performed) might show organic traces</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Hand-molded and burnished surface; Decorative swirling patterns are incised, likely post-molding but pre-firing; Hollow body crafted in sections and joined, typical of early ceramic traditions</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Found With:</strong> Typically found alongside small ceramic figurines, other effigy vessels, and sometimes burial goods (if funerary context)</li>
          <li><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Likely discovered in a domestic altar space or child/adult burial site; Zoomorphic forms frequently appear in burial contexts to serve the deceased or as symbolic companions</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Animal form (cow or bull) may relate to fertility, sustenance, or cosmic power; Swirling motifs might symbolize water, life cycles, or spiritual transformation</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Closely resembles ceramic effigy vessels from the Tlatilco culture (Central Mexico, c. 1200–900 BCE); Similar examples also found in Colima shaft tomb cultures, though more stylized in form there</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Artifact 5</h3>
        <img src="../images/collections/anth-artifact2.png" alt="Artifact 5" class="artifact-img">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name:</strong> The Terracotta Ancestral Vessel</li>
          <li><strong>Material:</strong> Hand-shaped terracotta (reddish-brown clay with coarse grit temper)</li>
          <li><strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> Height: ~34 cm; Width (at widest point): ~18 cm; Weight: ~2.6 kg; Shape: Rounded vessel body tapering into a modeled human face, surmounted by a pointed, conical headdress</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> </li>~2,200 years old (estimated through contextual dating with charcoal samples from the excavation layer; no direct carbon dating of the vessel itself since terracotta cannot be C14 tested)
          <li><strong>Preservation State:</strong> Nearly complete, minor surface erosion and weathering on facial details, but structurally intact</li>
          <li><strong>Location Found:</strong> Excavated in the Niger River Valley, near present-day Mali (fictional coordinates provided in dig notes: 13.45° N, 4.21° W). Found in a shallow burial pit alongside fragmented animal bones and two small copper ornaments</li>
          <li><strong>Use and Function</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Ceremonial vessel, possibly used for libation rituals or as a funerary container representing an honored ancestor</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Interior residues of ash and charred organic material suggest repeated burning of plant matter or offerings. Rim shows slight blackening from heat exposure</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Vessel constructed from coiled clay strips, smoothed by hand. Surface decorated with incised geometric bands around the headdress. Facial features carefully sculpted with stylized symmetry</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Context</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Found With:</strong> Two copper spiral bracelets, faunal remains (likely ritual sacrifice), and a broken grinding stone</li>
          <li><strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Secondary burial context within a communal ritual space (not a domestic dwelling). Soil discoloration indicates repeated use of fire in the area</li>
          <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The modeled face with closed eyes likely symbolizes ancestral guardianship or spiritual mediation. The pointed headdress is interpreted as a status marker, possibly denoting a priest or clan leader</li>
          <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Shares stylistic similarities with known terracotta figures of the Nok culture (Nigeria) and the later Ife sculptural tradition, but the vessel form and headdress style are distinct, suggesting a localized cultural expression</li>
        </ul>
